                    Real Madrid have once again defined an era in world football, winning four European Cups and four
                    Club
                    World Cup. In 2014, they lifted La Décima, before winning the Club World Cup that same year.
                    Zidane's
                    first two seasons in the dugout were historic, clinching La Undécima and La Duodécima. What's more,
                    2017
                    became a record-breaking year when the team got their hands on five trophies: The European Cup, the
                    Club
                    World Cup, LaLiga and the European and Spanish Super Cups. La Decimotercera then came in 2018, when
                    they
                    came out on top against Liverpool in Kiev.

                        Real Madrid’s plans for next year are pretty clear that they have targeted to land both Kylian
                        Mbappe and Erling Haaland in the 2022 transfer market. Real Madrid has added two more players to
                        their squad this season, one being David Alaba from Bayern Munich and Eduardo Camavinga from
                        Rennes
