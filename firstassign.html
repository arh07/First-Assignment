                    Real Madrid have once again defined an era in world football, winning four European Cups and four
                    Club
                    World Cup. In 2014, they lifted La Décima, before winning the Club World Cup that same year.
                    Zidane's
                    first two seasons in the dugout were historic, clinching La Undécima and La Duodécima. What's more,
                    2017
                    became a record-breaking year when the team got their hands on five trophies: The European Cup, the
                    Club
                    World Cup, LaLiga and the European and Spanish Super Cups. La Decimotercera then came in 2018, when
                    they
                    came out on top against Liverpool in Kiev.

                    Bangladesh forms the larger and eastern part of the Bengal region.[17] According to the ancient
                    Indian
                    texts, Rāmāyana and Mahābhārata, the Vanga Kingdom, one of the namesakes of the Bengal region,
                    was a
                    strong
                    naval power. In the ancient and classical periods of the Indian subcontinent, the territory was
                    home
                    to
                    many
                    principalities, including the Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata, and Harikela. It was also a
                    Mauryan
                    province under the reign of Ashoka. The principalities were notable for their overseas trade,
                    contacts
                    with
                    the Roman world, the export of fine muslin and silk to the Middle East, and spreading of
                    philosophy
                    and
                    art
                    to Southeast Asia. The Gupta Empire, Pala Empire, the Chandra dynasty, and the Sena dynasty were
                    the
                    last
                    pre-Islamic Bengali middle kingdoms. Islam was introduced during the Pala Empire, through trade
                    with
                    the
                    Abbāsid Caliphate,[18] but following the Ghurid conquests led by Bakhtiyār Khaljī, the
                    establishment
                    of
                    the
                    Delhi Sultanate and preaching of Shah Jalāl in the north-east, it spread across the entire
                    region.
                    In
                    1576,
                    the wealthy Bengal Sultanate was absorbed into the Mughal Empire, but its rule was briefly
                    interrupted
                    by
                    the Sūr Empire. Mughal Bengal, worth 12% of world GDP (late 17th century), experienced
                    proto-industrialisation, showed signs of a possible industrial revolution,[19][20] established
                    relations
                    with the Dutch and English East India Company, and became also the basis of the Anglo-Mughal
                    War.
                    Following
                    the death of Emperor Aurangzēb Ālamgir and Governor Shāista Khān in the early 1700s, the region
                    became a
                    semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal.
